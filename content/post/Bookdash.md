### About

Book Dash believes that every child should own one hundred books by the age of five.
To that end, we gather creative professionals who volunteer to create new, African storybooks that anyone can freely translate, print and distribute. In this way, we have vastly reduced the costs involved in putting high-quality books in childrenâ€™s hands and hearts.
