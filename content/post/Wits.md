### Problem statement

- Create an online platform that will house content which provides an additional layer of engagement with our exhibitions and education programme.
- Use the online platform to bridge language barriers; thus allowing us to reach a wider audience.
- Develop the online platform in such a way that it can be used as a way to connect and engage with the museum, without being there physically. This will allow for engagement with international constituencies and encourage relationships between them.
- The online platform should be easy to use; we would like teachers from around the country to be able to use our content and education programme, even if they cannot reach us physically.

The online platform should be accessible to anyone and should be created in such a way that can work around barriers such as data consumption or lack of access to smartphones or laptops.
