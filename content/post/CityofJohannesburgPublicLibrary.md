Johannesburg's public libraries are hubs of education, giving residents access to books, magazines and audio-visual materials.
Besides lending out material, the City’s libraries offer a wide-range of other services including literacy classes, storytelling
sessions for youngsters, classroom support, gatherings for older residents and literary competitions.
They are also the venues for lectures, exhibitions, and talks. Libraries can be found across the City’s seven regions, and mobile satellite centres also travel to far-flung areas.

### Challenges:

Edutainment, Awareness, Virtual Experiences and Virtual merchandising


### Data set available:

- Oral recordings
- Written content by senior citizens as contributions to the library
- [Videos and photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18ZAEUY6PiFpSTpoW5U7PO6Qrbatf4Gfw?usp=sharing)
- Catalogue of indigenous knowledge
- Library profiles




### Problem statement

Need an online platform/website that can be accessible to users/public to easily find information about libraries and services. To support this a communication channel/forum that will empower libraries to better communicate with the public.
