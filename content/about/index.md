### Welcome to Hack Ur Culture

We are excited to welcome you to the first Hack Ur Culture. This year we have 200 creative problem solvers gathering from 20 different African countries looking to bring GLAM institutions into a virtual future!

Apologies for the slow kick off we wanted to onboard as many of the Hack Ur Culture community on to Discord before formal proceedings kick off. We trust that you have found your way around Discord, exploring the different features and functions that will support your communication during Hack Ur Culture.

Please know that as you are hacking your solutions so are we as organisers. We are one community on a mission to shape the future of African cultural heritage. We remain committed to being agile and to communicate effectively to ensure we work together as a Hack Ur Culture community.

Our role is to support communication and organisation on the Discord to see the realisation of team formations and successful project development.

To do so effectively we need feedback. Please if you have positive suggestions and recommendations post them in the  #Feedback channel and we will aim to integrate that as we constantly work at improving the Hack Ur Culture experience.

To further empower our Hack Ur Culture community we are building a mentor network to be accessible per request, facilitating engagements with the different GLAM partners to support your design process and curating a series of panel discussions and guest lectures to keep us all critically engaged with the task at hand.

Please see an overview of the Hack Ur Culture program below:

#### Overview:

Hack Ur Culture is taking place over 3 weeks with project submissions due 18 October 2020, 23:59 CAT.

We are using an adapted design thinking framework to help give structure to this 3 week virtual hackathon

Week 1: 28 September 2020 - 4 October 2020 - **Empathize**
Week 2: 5 October 2020 - 11 October 2020 - **Ideate**
Week 3: 12 October 2020 - 18 October 2020 - **Prototype**

Please see full program over here (`link to google sheet - Updates will also be shared here`)

#### Next steps

As a community our first goal is to ensure we can all join a team and access our own communication channels where you can work with your team for the next 3 weeks.

To support this, Sunday, 27 September 2020 will be the last day for new Hack Ur Culture participants to join the Discord. We ask that you please spread the word in your own networks to inform other members to check their emails (Spam/Social/Promotion) and join the Discord ASAP.

We note that there are team members who will not be joining the Discord server; please ensure you share all necessary information with them.

Our goal is to ensure that by Wednesday, 30 September 2020 everybody is in a team.
